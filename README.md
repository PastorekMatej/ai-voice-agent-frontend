# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.







## üê≥ Docker Implementation

This frontend is fully containerized using Docker with production-ready optimizations. The implementation uses a multi-stage build process for optimal performance and security.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- **Multi-stage Docker build**: Separate build and production stages
- **Node.js 18 Alpine**: Lightweight build environment
- **Nginx Alpine**: Production web server
- **Optimized asset serving**: Gzip compression, caching headers, security headers
- **Health checks**: Container monitoring and orchestration support
- **Environment configuration**: Flexible deployment across different environments

# Test static assets
curl -I http://localhost:3000/static/js/main.<hash>.js
curl -I http://localhost:3000/static/css/main.<hash>.css

# Test main application

### üöÄ Cloud Deployment

#### Google Cloud Run
```bash
# Build and tag for GCR
docker build -t gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/ai-voice-frontend:latest .

# Push to Google Container Registry
docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/ai-voice-frontend:latest

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy ai-voice-frontend \
  --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/ai-voice-frontend:latest \
  --platform managed \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars REACT_APP_API_URL=https://backend-url
```

#### AWS ECS / Azure Container Instances
```bash
# Tag for AWS ECR
docker tag ai-voice-frontend:latest <account>.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/ai-voice-frontend:latest

# Tag for Azure ACR
docker tag ai-voice-frontend:latest <registry>.azurecr.io/ai-voice-frontend:latest
```

### üêõ Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Container won't start:**
```bash
# Check Docker Desktop is running
docker --version

# Check port availability
netstat -an | findstr :3000  # Windows
lsof -i :3000                # macOS/Linux
```

**Build failures:**
```bash
# Clear Docker cache
docker builder prune

# Rebuild without cache
docker build --no-cache -t ai-voice-frontend:latest .

# Check .dockerignore excludes
cat .dockerignore
```

**Asset loading issues:**
```bash
# Verify build output
docker exec -it <container> ls -la /usr/share/nginx/html/static

# Check nginx configuration
docker exec -it <container> cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Test asset paths
curl -I http://localhost:3000/static/js/main.<hash>.js
```

**API connection issues:**
```bash
# Check environment variables
docker exec -it <container> env | grep REACT_APP

# Test API connectivity (if backend in Docker)
docker exec -it <container> curl http://backend:5001/health
```

#### Performance Optimization

**Build optimization:**
```bash
# Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
echo "node_modules\n.git\nbuild\ncoverage" >> .dockerignore

# Multi-stage builds reduce final image size
# Build stage: ~800MB ‚Üí Production stage: ~25MB
```

**Runtime optimization:**
```bash
# Enable gzip compression (already configured)
# Static asset caching (already configured)
# Security headers (already configured)

# Monitor container resources
docker stats <container-name>
```

### üìä Monitoring and Health Checks

#### Built-in Health Monitoring
```bash
# Docker health check (automatic)
docker ps  # Shows (healthy) status

# Manual health verification
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Expected response: "healthy"
```

#### Container Metrics
```bash
# Resource usage
docker stats --no-stream <container-name>

# Container processes
docker exec -it <container-name> ps aux

# Network connections
docker port <container-name>
```

### üîê Security Considerations

- **Non-root user**: Nginx runs as non-root in container
- **Security headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection
- **Minimal attack surface**: Alpine Linux base images
- **No sensitive data**: Build-time secrets not persisted in image layers
- **Environment separation**: Different configs for dev/staging/prod
